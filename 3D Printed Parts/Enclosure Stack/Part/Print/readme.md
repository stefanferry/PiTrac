# 3D Printed Parts – Enclosure Stack / Part / Print

**WARNING**: this is a first draft! Only print if you are curious and got filament to spare :D.  
This README provides an overview of all 3D-printable components for the "stack type" enclosure.

## ⚠️ Safety Disclaimer

**Important:** These 3D-printed parts are designed to house components connected to mains voltage (100–240V AC). Please observe the following safety precautions:

- Only place the assembled unit on a **stable, non-flammable surface**.  
- Never leave the unit **powered on and unattended**.  
- Keep out of reach of **children and pets**.  
- Ensure proper **ventilation** around the power supply to avoid overheating. (not bedded into artificial turf)  
- Handle electrical connections **carefully** and only if you are confident with mains electricity.  
- Avoid **cable damage**: do not pinch wires or run them over sharp edges.  
- Use proper **fuses or circuit protection** in the IEC connector.  
- Always verify **correct polarity and connections** before powering on.  
- **Material choice matters**: PLA is flammable; consider PETG or ABS for better heat resistance, ideally UL94 V-0 certified.  
- Ensure **print quality**: no gaps or thin walls that could expose live components.  
- Do not operate the unit in **wet or humid environments**.  
- Keep all small parts **secure and away from children or pets**.  
- Use **appropriate tools** for assembly and avoid sharp edges.  
- Clearly **mark modules and polarity** where relevant to prevent mistakes.
- Take care not to **drop screws or other components** into the power supply during assembly.
- Always install the **LinePower_Cover.stl** to minimize the risk of electric shock.

Failure to follow these precautions can result in **fire, electric shock, or personal injury**. Print and use these parts at your own risk.

## ℹ️ Notes

- **Build Plate Face:** The surface that should be placed on the print bed.  
- **Build Plate Adhesion:** e.g., *None*, *Skirt*, *Brim*, *Raft*.  
- **Support:** e.g., *None*, *Touching Buildplate*, *Everywhere*.  
- **Amount:** Number of required copies.
- **Material:** It is advised to use UL94 V-0 compliant filament.
- **Stack_Module:** The stack module can be sectioned into three pieces if print duration per part is an issue. One horizontal cut 3mm above bottom, and one vertical cut in the center plane.
